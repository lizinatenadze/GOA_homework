      <h3><ol>
         <li>The potatoes are washed and peeled by machines.</li>
         <li>Workers hand-cut any imperfections off the potatoes.</li>
         <li>The fries shoot through a tube at about 75 MPH through cutting machines.</li>
         <li>Optical strips look at every single fry and remove any with a fault.</li>
         <li>They are blanched in precisely maintained 170° water for about 15 minutes to allow for a soft interior.</li>
         <li>The fries are completely dried.</li>
         <li>They are then quickly fried for the 1st time at 400° F.</li>
         <li>From here, they go into a freezer at 10°F.</li>
         <li>Once frozen, they are shipped to restaurants.</li>
         <li>Once at the restaurant, they are fried for a second time, salted, and served.</li>
